# ü•™ Welcome to ClauDELI

## üìñ Project Description
ClauDELI is a custom sandwich shop application. It automates the ordering process, letting users build their sandwich exactly how they want. Orders are saved as text files in a `receipts` folder, named with the date and time the order was placed. The app uses Object-Oriented Programming to provide a smooth and flexible ordering experience.

## üë©‚Äçüíª Interesting Piece of Code
![InterestingPieceOfCode](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/823bc5bb-c2ca-410b-8b0b-a45a6443331f)  
This class helps manage input from users and improves the program‚Äôs reliability:
- Keeps the code clean and avoids repeating the same input-checking tasks in different parts of the app.  
- Makes sure the user enters numbers within a specific range.  
- Handles cases when the user types something that isn‚Äôt a number, preventing errors or crashes.  
- Adds clear dividers in the console to make menus and information easier to read.

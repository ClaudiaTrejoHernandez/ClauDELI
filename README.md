# 🥪 Welcome to ClauDELI 👩‍🍳 

## 📖 Description of Project ✏️
This is a custom sandwich shop. This application will now automate the order process of the ClauDELI sandwich shop.

## 👩‍💻Interesting piece of code
  - Designed as a reusable tool to keep the code neat and avoid repeating the same tasks in different parts of the project.
  - Provides easy ways for the program to ask the user for numbers and make sure they’re valid.
  - Checks that numbers entered by the user are within a range (for example, between 1 and 5).
  - Prevents errors and crashes when the user types something that isn’t a number.
  - Includes a simple way to add clear dividers in the console, making menus and information easier to see.
